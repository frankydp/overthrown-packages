OverThrown development started June 15th.

* **Turn-based.** Each turn is 12 hours. Players give orders to their armies and once every 12 hours armies move and resources are collected. This way the game does not take a lot of time to play. People can check in twice a day and don't have to constantly watch the game.

* **Alliances.** Overthrown is a team game.  Teamwork is required to win. Players can form alliances. Troops of players in an alliance don't fight each other. Max 5 players per alliance. Capitals belong to alliances not players. The winners of the game are the players in the winning alliance.

* Keep it simple. No tree or market like Dominus. Only one troop and resource type. Cannot attack castles only villages, armies and capitals.

* To win an alliance must capture all capital buildings.

* Games are 50 players max. Maps don't expand, they're all the same size and start that way.

* Prevent duplicate accounts. No transferring anything to other players. Players start with no troops. Villages are built by workers who can't fight.

* Playable in browsers, phones and tables. Android and iOS apps. One simple interface that works everywhere.

* Browser version is free with ads.  Android and iOS apps cost a small amount and have occasional ads.

* **Villages** Villages are built by workers.  Workers can be killed by enemy soldiers.  If they're killed they are created again automatically at player's castle.  Max 3 workers per player.  Workers take one turn to build and do not cost any gold.  Villages collect resources fromt he 9 squares surrounding and under the village.  Brown squares produce nothing.  Light green squares produce 1 gold and dark green squares produce 3 gold.
