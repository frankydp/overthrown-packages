OverThrown development started June 15th. Lobby, forums and chat are working.  Next is starting a game and the map.

* **Turn-based.** One turn is 12 hours. Players give orders to their armies and once every 12 hours armies move and resources are collected. This way the game does not take a lot of time to play. People can check in twice a day and don't have to constantly watch the game. Doesn't matter what time or timezone games start.

* **Alliances.** The game is all about alliances. Players don't win games, alliances do. Troops of players in an alliance don't fight each other. Capitals belong to alliances not players. It's a team game.

* Keep it simple. No tree or market like Dominus. Only one troop type. Cannot attack castles only villages, armies and capitals.

* To win an alliance must capture all capital buildings.

* Games are 50 players max. Maps don't expand, they're all the same size and start that way.

* Prevent dupes. No transferring anything to other players. Players start with no troops. Villages are built by workers who can't fight.

* Playable in browsers and phones/tables. One simple interface that works everywhere.

Docs are on [Github](https://github.com/dan335/overthrown-packages).
