When a soldier lands on the same square as an enemy soldier, worker, village or city they will attack it.  Soldiers cannot attack castles.  When a turn ends all characters move one square then battles run.  Characters then move another square and battles run again until all characters have moved the maximum amount.  Battles are decided by the number of soldiers in the battle.  If an army of 8 soldiers attacks an army of 3 soldiers the smaller army will all die and the larger army will have 5 soldiers left.  All workers die if they are in the same square as an enemy soldier.  Villages are destroyed if there are no ally soldiers in that square when enemy soldiers attack.
