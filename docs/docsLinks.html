OverThrown development started June 15th 2016. Please report bugs in the forum.

OverThrown is playable in browsers, phones and tablets.  Android and iOS apps will be available. One simple interface that works everywhere.  Browser version is free with ads. Android and iOS apps have occasional ads.  An ad-free version can be purchased.

Preventing players from creating duplicate accounts is very hard.  Instead gameplay is designed to discourage duplicate accounts.  Players cannot transfer anything to other players.  Players start with no soldiers only workers who cannot fight.
