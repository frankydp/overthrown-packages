OverThrown is a turn-based game.  Each turn is 12 hours.

Players give orders to their armies and once every 12 hours armies and workers move and resources are collected.

Because turns are 12 hours long the game does not take a lot of time to play. Players can check in twice a day and don't have to constantly watch the game.
