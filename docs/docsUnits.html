Every player has one castle.  Your castle will have a green flag.  Enemies will have a red flag.  Neutral buidings a white one and allies a blue flag.

Castles produce workers and soldiers.

Workers are for building villages.  Soldiers for attacking cities or enemies.  Villages for collecting gold and producing soldiers.
