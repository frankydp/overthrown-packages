Villages are built by workers.  Workers can be killed by enemy soldiers.  If they're killed they are created again automatically at player's castle.  Max 3 workers per player.  Workers take one turn to build and do not cost any gold.  Villages collect resources from the 9 squares surrounding and under the village.  Brown squares produce nothing.  Light green squares produce 1 gold and dark green squares produce 3 gold.
