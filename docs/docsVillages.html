Villages collect resources from the surrounding squares and produce soldiers.

Use a worker to build a village but be careful, workers can be killed by enemy soldiers.  If they're killed they are created again automatically at player's castle.  Max {{_s.numWorkersPerPlayer}} workers per player.

Workers build villages instantly and do not cost any gold.  Villages collect resources from the 9 squares surrounding and under the village.  Brown squares produce nothing.  Light green squares produce 2 gold and dark green squares produce 6 gold.

Villages can hire soldiers and can be used as forward bases.
